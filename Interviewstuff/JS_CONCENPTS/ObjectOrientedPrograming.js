4 Pillers  

1. Encapsulation
2. Abstraction 
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism


Explain Encapsulation ?
=====================
 
Wrapping up of data into single unit , here property's and methods wrap up into single object to reduce complexity and increase resubality ;


Example : 

LocalStroge : {
	  length:"Number"
	  getData()
	  setData()
}


Abstraction
============

Hiding the logic , TV and Remote 

Hiding property ourside the Object or functions .. which imapacts on reducing complexity


Inheritance
===========

Redundency Code we can improve with this ... using prototype property we can achive this 


Polymorphism:
============
many ways , forms 


HtmlElemtnts : {

    hidden
   innerHTML
    click()
    focus()

  }

  var textBoc = new HtmlElemtnts()
  var select = new HtmlElemtnts()
  var checkbox = new HtmlElemtnts()

  if we want to run on proceduarl programming then we need to render each of the function but in OOP just use element.render

  it will avoid Switch cases and makes more comfortable
